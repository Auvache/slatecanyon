                    <p><strong>Stake Mission Prep Updates</strong><br />
                        Under the direction of the Stake Presidency, we are trying to move to more in-person but small group meetings.  Therefore, we are changing the structure and scope of our Mission Prep class for March.<br />
                        The start date is being pushed back to <strong>Sunday March 14th</strong>.<br />
                        The Mission Prep classes will now be held <strong>IN PERSON at the STAKE CENTER.</strong><br />
                        We will hold ALL of the Mission Prep classes <strong>ONLY for those youth who turn 16 or older this year.</strong><br />
                        In order to comply with state rules, we will be breaking into smaller groups.  The facilitators and speakers will rotate through each group so that all of the groups get the same teaching. Masks wearing and Social Distancing will apply.<br /><br />
                        The youth are invited to submit questions about missionary work and preparation before classes begin at this link: <a href="http://bit.ly/ProvoStakeMissionPrep21">http://bit.ly/ProvoStakeMissionPrep21</a>

                    <p><strong>Junior Primary Activity</strong><br />
                        We are having our first in person activity for junior primary on the 27th from 3-3:30. Junior primary includes Sunbeams,and CTR 4,5 and 6. This is kids who were ages 3-6 as of Jan 1st.
                        The senior primary kids (ages 7 and up)  are invited to attend in person activity days which occur more frequently. We anticipate doing a junior primary activity once a month. 
                        Per state order, facemasks are required. We will be splitting into groups of approximately 10 or less. It's not required to attend but we look forward to a fun celebration of Easter and a preparation for general conference. </p>
